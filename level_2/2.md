### clues:
 - text: recognize the characters. maybe they are in the book, but MAYBE they are in the page source.
 - page source: find rare characters in the mess below: ...A lot of characters
---

### task:
find rare characters in the page source

---
### solution:
- get the page source from url
    #### code: 
    ```
    def get_page_source(url):
      page_source = requests.get(url).text
      return page_source
  ```
- use a method split() to get the string from page source
  #### code:
  ```
  def split_page_source(page_source):
    splitA = page_source.split('<!--')
    splitB = splitA[-1].split('-->')
    return splitB[0]
  ```
- use in Hash table to count characters
  #### code:
  ```
  def create_Hash_table(page_source_split):
    dict_characters = {}
    for i in page_source_split:
        if i in dict_characters:
            dict_characters[i] += 1
        else:
            dict_characters[i] = 1
    return dict_characters
  ```
- find the rare characters
  #### code:
  ```
  def find_rare_characters(dict_characters):
    min = 1
    rare_characters = ''
    while len(rare_characters) == 0:
        print(rare_characters)
        for i in dict_characters:
            if dict_characters[i] == min:
                rare_characters += i
        min += 1
    return rare_characters
  ```
- Now all that remains is to change the end of the url used method replace()
  #### code:
  ```
  def replace_url(url, old_url, url_to_replace):
    new_url = url.replace(old_url, url_to_replace)
    webbrowser.open(new_url)
    return new_url
  ```
