### clues:
 - text: One small letter, surrounded by EXACTLY three big bodyguards on each of its sides.
 - page source title: re (>> Regular Expression)
 - page source: ..A lot of characters
---

### task:
Retrieve from page source strings that are defined by Regular Expression -> '[a-z][A-Z]{3}[a-z][A-Z]{3}[a-z]', Then pull out the middle letter from each string.

---
### solution:
- get the page source from url
    #### code: 
    ```
    def get_page_source(url):
      page_source = requests.get(url).text
      return page_source
  ```
- use a method split() to get the string from page source
  #### code:
  ```
  def split_page_source(page_source):
    splitA = page_source.split('<!--')
    splitB = splitA[-1].split('-->')
    return splitB[0]
  ```
- use in Regular Expression to find characters
  #### code:
  ```
  def find_letter_use_re(page_source_split):
    filter = '[a-z][A-Z]{3}[a-z][A-Z]{3}[a-z]'
    all = re.findall(filter, page_source_split)
    sol = ''.join(i[len(i)//2] for i in all)
    return sol
  ```

- Now all that remains is to change the end of the url used method replace()
  #### code:
  ```
  def replace_url(url, old_url, url_to_replace):
    new_url = url.replace(old_url, url_to_replace)
    webbrowser.open(new_url)
    return new_url
  ```
